"""Grammar-constrained ``apply_patch`` file writes for GPT-5+ models.

GPT-5+ models degenerate when they stream a whole file as one JSON-escaped
``write_file`` argument: at the end of an indented block they keep emitting
content (blank lines, cycling lines, invented entries) until the output cap
cuts the call mid-string. OpenAI's own harness never sends these models a JSON
file-write tool. Its only file tool is a freeform ``apply_patch`` custom tool
whose input is raw V4A patch text, constrained by a Lark grammar and closed by
an explicit ``*** End Patch`` line.

This module gives the same surface to those models without adding a tool to
Hermes. On the wire the model sees ``apply_patch`` in place of ``write_file``
and ``patch``. Everywhere else the call is the existing ``patch`` tool in V4A
mode (``{"mode": "patch", "patch": <text>}``), so approvals, checkpoints,
display and file-mutation tracking need no changes:

- :func:`rewrite_request` swaps the tools, keeps other tools from pointing the
  model back at write_file or patch, and translates history on the way out.
- :func:`internal_arguments` (streamed) and :func:`normalize_response`
  (non-streamed) translate a completed call on the way back in.

DESCRIPTION = """Create, replace, edit or delete files with a patch. This is a FREEFORM tool: send the patch text itself, not JSON.

This is the only file-writing tool in this session. It replaces write_file and patch: whenever instructions say to write, create, overwrite, edit or patch a file, use apply_patch. Do not look for another file tool or write files from scripts or shell commands.

*** Begin Patch
*** Add File: <path>
+<every line of the new file, each prefixed with +>
*** Update File: <path>
@@ <optional line near the change>
 <unchanged line>
-<line to remove>
+<line to add>
*** Delete File: <path>
*** End Patch

Add File creates a file or replaces an existing one completely. Update File edits an existing file: include about 3 unchanged lines around each change so its location is unambiguous. One patch may touch several files."""
